# StellarLingo

StellarLingo is a Web3-based language learning platform built on the Stellar Blockchain using Soroban. It offers an innovative "learn-to-earn" model where users are incentivized to learn new languages through rewards and achievements.

## Project Overview

StellarLingo aims to revolutionize language learning by leveraging blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and incentivized learning experience. By integrating the Stellar Blockchain and Soroban smart contracts, StellarLingo ensures that user progress and rewards are immutable and transparent.

## Problem

Traditional language learning platforms often struggle to maintain user engagement and motivation. Users may find it challenging to stay committed to their learning goals due to a lack of incentives and a sense of progress.

## Solution

StellarLingo addresses these challenges by implementing a "learn-to-earn" model. Users are rewarded with tokens for completing lessons, achieving milestones, and staying consistent with their learning. These tokens can be used within the platform or traded on the Stellar network, providing real-world value and motivation for learners.

## Technologies Used

- **Stellar Blockchain**: Ensures secure and transparent transactions and data storage.
- **Soroban**: A smart contract platform for the Stellar Blockchain used to implement the application's logic.
- **Node.js**: Backend server to handle API requests and interactions with the blockchain.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js to build the backend server.
- **React**: Frontend framework to create a user-friendly interface.
